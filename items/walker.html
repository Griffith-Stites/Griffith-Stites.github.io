        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
        <p>I developed software to calibrate the Vision Test Stands at JDES (John Deere Electronic Solutions). The testers verify the functionality of displays used in John Deere tractors and construction equipment. Each Vision Test Stand uses a camera to view the display and a pneumatic finger to interact with the display.<br><br>
        This project's goal was to calibrate the Vision Test Stands to make them functionality identical - to reduce the number of false failures during manufacturing. I used a pre-existing Vision Test Stand Diagnostic Fixture for a common reference to calibrate the stands. I wrote software to generate a local machine offset for the Pneumatic Finger position - such that the coordinate system was identical on all testers. I also wrote software to generate a table of exposures and expected color hues for each tester. Finally, I wrote reusable software to allow engineers to easily interact with these calibration files in their own code.</p>

        <h3 id="my-role">My Role</h3>
        <p>I managed the Vision Stand Calibration project. I brought the project all the way from an initial problem to completion.
        This role included:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left:100">
          <li>Project planning - When I first got this project, I was told to find a way to calibrate the finger and camera on the Vision Test Stands. It was my responsibility to come up with the approach on how to do this. </li>
          <li>Software Design - I created the calibration file format, software to generate the calibration files, and reusable software to access the calibration files for use in test software on the stands. All of the code was written in NI LabVIEW.</li>
          <li>Documentation - I created extensive documentation on all of the software I wrote and my engineering process. This included information on how to maintain and update the code I wrote, as well as how to use the utilities which access the calibration file data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="approach">Documentation and Details</h3>
