    <h3 >FIRST Robotics Competition Overview</h3>
    <p>FIRST Robotics is a K-12 program where students learn engineering, technology, and teamwork skills through robotics. FRC is the highest level in FIRST and participants are High School students.</p>

    <p>Every year there is a new game (accompanied by a 100+ page rule book, a fun read) released at the same time globally. Teams then have six weeks before bag day to design, build, and test their robot. In FRC, teams build metal bots weighing around 140 lbs.</p>

    <p>At the Regionals, there are a number of qualification matches where three teams are put into an alliance, and two alliances play a match against each other. After qualifications, there are elimination matches, where the top eight teams get to choose their alliance.</p>

    <h3>2018 Competition</h3>
    <p>The 2018 FRC Competition was PowerUp. The game involved moving and delivering cubes to a “scale” and “switch” on the field. There was also a climbing component at the end of the round.</p>

    <p>The first stage of each round was an Autonomous stage, where the robot would drive itself. Our robot could deliver a cube to the switch or the scale during this period. We were even featured on the AndyMark (a distributor that deals in lots of FRC parts) YouTube channel for having a fast Autonomous delivery to the switch.</p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>During the 2018 robotics season I led a team of 55 students as the Team Captain. I was in charge of the whole team. This included leading electrical, mechanical design, build, software, and public relations sub teams.</p>

    <p>My tasks included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scheduling - I was in charge of managing the schedule for the six week build season. Throughout the build season, the team built four separate robots. The final robot was assembled half way through week four, which allows time for bug fixing, minor modifications, assembly of spare parts, and driver practice. I used adult mentor perspectives and experience with previous robotics seasons for guidance.</li>
      <li>Meeting Planning - I would work with team leadership to create meeting itineraries. Our team meet five times a week: 6-8pm Monday through Thursday and 9-3pm on Saturday.</li>
      <li>Delegation - I split up large tasks and gave them to different members on the team. If they were larger mechanical, electrical, or software tasks, I would work with the appropriate section lead to divide up the task and get appropriate due dates on it.</li>
      <li>Mentoring - As a more technically experienced member of the team, I taught skills to the newer members on the team. During the off season, I would organize educational meetings where the team would break into groups to learn different skills they were interested in. I led sessions that involved robot electronics, fabrication, public relations, FRC strategy, mechanical design.</li>
      <li>Mechanical Design - My main role during this season was an administrative role, but I also helped design mechanical pieces of the robot. I managed the master CAD assembly. This was where all of the smaller robot components would be assembled together in one file, forming a CAD prototype for testing before any assembly.</li>
      <li>Electrical - The previous robotics season I was the Electrical Lead. I helped with wiring the robot and with recommendations of various sensors for the robot. My main electrical role in the 2018 build season was as an mentoring role for other students.</li>
      <li>Quality Management - I reviewed the work of other students before parts were made and put on the robot.</li>
      <li>Team Building - I led team building events to help the team health, communication, and comfort. This included a few LAN parties (getting together in one space to play video games on a local network) which I hosted at my house.</li>
      <li>Pit Management - At the Regionals, each team has a pit where they can repair and work on their robot. I was in charge of making sure the pit ran smoothly and assigned Pit Bosses to keep pit personal managed and the robot in good condition.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Since Regionals are at the end of the season, I took a more hands off approach to management to allow the younger students to develop leadership and management skills.</li>
        <li>One of my proudest moments was at the Iowa Regional, where I barely had to intervene in the pit. The Pit Bosses and younger students keep things running smoothly all on their own. It was amazing to see their growth over the course of the year.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drive Coach - I managed pre-match strategy meetings and helped the drivers and human players make strategic decisions during matches.</li>
    <li>Alliance Selection - I worked with our scouting team to select robots for our alliance for elimination matches.</li>
    <li>Sponsor Interactions - I wrote sponsor letters and requests for funding to our various sponsors.</li>
  </ul>

      <h3>Documentation and Details</h3>

      <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/drivetrains_explained.jpg" alt="White board with expo sketches" />
        Here I am explaining drive trains to newer members of the team as part of an off-season educational meeting that I planned.</p>

        <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/electrical_explained1.jpg" alt="People around a table watching me speak" />
          I am working with a mentor to explain robotic electronics to members of the team interested in working on the Electrical sub-team.</p>

          <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/electrical_explained5.jpg" alt="People around a whiteboard covered table watching me explain how to crimp a wire" />
            As part of another off-season educational meeting I planned, I am explaining the more about robot electronics. In this session, I explained the major parts used on our robots: motor controllers, power distribution panel, voltage regulator modules, pneumatic control module and the RoboRio (our main computer).</p>

            <p>I also taught the students which wires and connectors to use in different scenarios, as well as how to strip and crimp wires.</p>

            <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/silver_explained3.jpg" alt="People working on silver, reaching their hands into the robot">

            <p>As a finale to the off-season electrical education meetings, I am having the students rewire a previous year’s bot. Here, I am showing students how to run wires and how/where to make different connections.</p>

            <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/frame1.jpg" alt="First frame on a green carpet with wooden mocks of the field elements">

            <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/frame1.3.jpg" alt="An aluminum frame with only four motors and a camera with a green led ring around it" />
              Our first prototype frame. Just testing the frame to allow programmers to start testing code and start working on vision tracking for the autonomous period.</p>

              <p>Our drive train of choice was a swerve drive train. Swerve is a drive train where you have a wheel at all four corners that can turn 360 degrees and drive the robot. There are two motors on each wheel: one for driving the wheel, and one for rotating the wheel’s orientation. This was a drive train my team developed during my junior year when I was the Electrical Lead. It has a lot of challenges for electrical and programming teams due to the sensors required.</p>

              <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/arm_thought.jpg" alt="arm thought" />
                I am working with the mechanical lead to discuss the first iteration of my arm design. We did testing without a motor to see if the motion was right. We discussed how to attach a motor, how to modify the rear arm to give a smoother motion, and how to adjust tolerances to make assembly easier.</p>

                <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/both_bots.jpg" alt="Both bots" />
                  We were developing an arm and lift in parallel to test what would make a better lifting mechanism. You can see both bots in this photo. We were also testing two different drive train and frame versions in this photo.</p>

                  <p>An arm I designed on an early version of the robot. In the end, I made the decision for the team to pursue the lift (abandoning my own design). It was determined that the arm would be too hard to program given the time left and would be hard to fix if it broke in competition. This decision was made with consultation from team mentors and team leads.</p>

                    Testing an early version of the lift bot. This was using a left over drive train from the previous season for more rapid testing.</p>

                    <h3>Outreach and Easter Eggs</h3>
                    <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/girl_scouts3.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts Explaining">

                    <p>Here I am explaining how our previous robot works to a group of girl scouts. They were most excited when they got to touch the robot and drive it.</p>

                    <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/girl_scouts5.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts Explaining">

                    <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/girlscouts1.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts Explaining">

                    <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/girlscouts2.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts Explaining">

                    <p>I am explaining our shop to girl scouts (there are different groups in these photos). I explained how the machines worked and answered any questions they had about them. I talked about the different tools and how to operate, including the CNC router, laser cutters, and welding tools.</p>

                    <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/Pit_Admin.jpg" alt="pit admin sign" />
                      Easter egg! This is me holding a sign that a number of team members made to me the day of the FTC qualifier at our facility. Our team was hosting an FTC qualifier and I was the pit administrator for the day. I was extremely excited about it, and the team had fun lightly mocking me for it.</p>

                      <img src="../images/portfolio/items/big_jake/laying_pit.jpg" alt="laying_pit" />
                        Easter egg! I am lying on a mat in the pit after an exhausting day of matches. The team took advantage of this to give me a hard time. I guess it was only fair.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                        <p>The process of leading a robotics team to build Big Jake was quite the journey. I enjoyed the technical challenges of designing a robot. I enjoyed delegating tasks and splitting up things amongst the team.</p>

                        <p>But more than anything, I enjoyed watching other students grow throughout the season and know I was a part of that journey. People who joined the team at the beginning of the season ended up being irreplaceable members of the pit crew. And when I headed off to college, it was tremendous to see others stepping in to fill the leadership space I had occupied.</p>

                        <p>I learned a lot from this experience and I grew a lot. I learned that managing people can be quite the challenge, but thankfully I had a great set of mentors to help me along the way. My confidence, communication, and management skills grew a ton.</p>

                        <p>Please reach out to me, I love talking about robots!</p>
