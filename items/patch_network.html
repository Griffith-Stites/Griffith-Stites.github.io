  <h1> Patch Panel Project </h1>
  <img src="../images/portfolio/patchpanelproject.jpg" alt="Cover photo"></p>
  <div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I led a patch project install at the Burns &amp; McDonnell Networking, Integration, and Automation (NIA) lab to reduce errors and increasing efficency. I managed the patch panel project and installed the patch network. This resulted in a decrease in engineering hours for lab testing and a safer lab environment.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Project planning - I planned the timeline for this project and did the preliminary research into the feasibility of different options for the patch network.</li>
      <li>Running team meetings - I had check-ins and planning meetings with the lab director, the NIA projects director, and other NIA engineers to give updates as well as take inputs and suggestions for the project.</li>
      <li>Managing material lists - I sourced all of the materials for the patch network. This included patch panels, keystones, cabling, connectors, cable management accessories, cable runways, and tools.</li>
      <li>Managing a $10,000 budget - Along with creating a materials list, I also worked to source items that would keep this project under budget.</li>
      <li>Installation - I installed the whole patch network. This included installing patch panels, installing keystones, running cables, terminating connectors, cable management, and continuity testing.</li>
    </ul>
