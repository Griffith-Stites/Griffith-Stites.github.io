        "description": "A website I built to support gender non-conforming and transgender people everywhere. The site seeks to break down gender norms and normalize gender non-conformity and people who live outside the binary. <p>  </p> The site consists of three main sections: a lookbook, poetry, and resources. The lookbook and poetry are sections where I use creativity and emotional vulnerability in the hopes that others who are struggling with similar issues can relate to me. The resources section has links to everything from basic terminology to extensive guides and support, some of the resources I created.<p>  </p> Creating this site helped me to learn a ton about HTML and CSS. It also helped me to grow as a creator and artist. Working on it also helped me to realize how far I have developed in my identity. It was tremendous to know that I was able to give back and help others who are struggling with the same things I did.",

When the flag is complete, an educational book is displayed. I worked on a variety of tasks including: the educational end screen books, the flashlight module, controller module, code organization, and the project website.",

These zines are aimed at high school students with an algebra understanding. They are meant to get students excited about math by giving purpose to the things they are learning.  <p>  </p>I created the zine format, wrote about the basics of Linear Algebra (Matrices, Vectors, Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors), explained how SVD works on an image, and developed the code examples (MATLAB, Python, and WolframAlpha).",

I worked with a partner to study the correlation between sleep and the spread of disease. We created a SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model to simulate the spread of disease through a population sample. We used Python to build this model.",

This included project planning, running team meetings, scheduling, managing material lists, and managing a budget.  <p>  </p>The project came in on time and under budget. In total, the project involved 21 separate racks which had Ethernet, single-mode fiber, 62.5Âµm multi-mode fiber, GPS signal, and IRIG clock signal connections. The project will save hundreds of engineering hours in the future as it makes connecting different devices across the lab fast, neat, and easy.",
