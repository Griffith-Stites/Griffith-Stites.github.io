        "description": "I worked with a team to develop Flag Quest. Flag Quest is a rogue like game created to spread awareness of LGBTQ+ identities by integrating the elements of LGBTQ+ flags into fun puzzles. The player navigates obstacles to collect colors of a certain LGBTQ+ Flag. When the flag is complete, an educational book is displayed. I worked on a variety of tasks including: the educational end screen books, the flashlight module, controller module, code organization, and the project website.",

        "description": "Pictured is a prediction of an outbreak on Olin's campus (left). The green line represents the recovered population, the orange line represents the susceptible population, and the blue line represents the infected population. The result was generated from our model using sleep data from an Olin student survey. On the right is a simulated disease with all students getting an extra hour of sleep. I worked with a partner to study the correlation between sleep and the spread of disease. We created a SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model to simulate the spread of disease through a population sample. We used Python to build this model.",

        "description": "I designed and installed a patch network for use in the Networking, Integration, and Automation (NIA) lab. This included project planning, running team meetings, scheduling, managing material lists, and managing a budget. The project came in on time and under budget. In total, the project involved 21 separate racks which had Ethernet, single-mode fiber, 62.5Âµm multi-mode fiber, GPS signal, and IRIG clock signal connections. The project will save hundreds of engineering hours in the future as it makes connecting different devices across the lab fast, neat, and easy.",

My presentation focused on my journey discovering my sexuality and gender expression. I used story telling strategies, humor, and activities to engage students. I received great feedback from the presentation, including a number of LGBTQ students who found the presentation inspiring and helpful.",

Swerve utilizes four wheels which are able to be independently turned 360 degrees. I worked to solve the new and challenging electrical and programming challenges which came with this new drive train. Examples of these challenges included accurately measuring wheel position and maintaining robot orientation. Silver won the Iowa regional and made it to the world competition.",
