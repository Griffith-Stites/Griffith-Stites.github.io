        "description": "I developed software to calibrate the Vision Test Stands at the JDES (John Deere Electronic Solutions) plant. These testers verify the functionality of displays made for use in John Deere tractors and construction equipement. Each Vision Test Stand uses a camera to view the display and a pneumatic finger to interact with the display.<br> <br> The software I wrote calibrated the Vision Test Stands and made them functionality identical. This reduced the number of false failures during manufacturing and number of engineering hours required to create tests on Vision Test Stands. I wrote software to generate a local machine offset for the Pneumatic Finger position. I also wrote software to generate a table of exposures and expected color hues for each tester. Finally, I wrote resuable software to allow engineers to easily interact with these calibration files in their own code.",

        "description": "During my internship with John Deere, I took on a number of Diversity & Inclusion Iniatives. The highlight of my summer was giving a presentation with over 200 attendees: 'Rainbow ERG Special Event: Life Stories of a Non-binary Person'. <br><br>This presentation was centered around my story: my identity, my identity journey, and experience interacting with the world as a non-binary person. I encouraged attendees to question how they see the world, understand that people have different lived experiences, help people have empathy for people unlike themselves, and to be able to translate that empathy into allyship.",

        "description": "A website I built to support gender non-conforming and transgender people everywhere. The site seeks to break down gender norms and normalize gender non-conformity and people who live outside the binary. <br><br> The site consists of three main sections: a lookbook, poetry, and resources. The lookbook and poetry are sections where I use creativity and emotional vulnerability in the hopes that others who are struggling with similar issues can relate to me. The resources section has links to everything from basic terminology to extensive guides and support, some of the resources I created.<br><br> Creating this site helped me to learn a ton about HTML and CSS. It also helped me to grow as a creator and artist. Working on it also helped me to realize how far I have developed in my identity. It was tremendous to know that I was able to give back and help others who are struggling with the same things I did.",
