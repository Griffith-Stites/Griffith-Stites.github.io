        "description": "I designed and installed a patch network for use in the Networking, Integration, and Automation (NIA) lab. This included project planning, running team meetings, scheduling, managing material lists, and budgeting. The project came in on time and under budget. In total, the project involved 21 seperate racks which had Ethernet, single-mode fiber, 62.5Âµm multi-mode fiber, GPS signal, and IRIG clock signal connections. The project will save hundreds of engineering hours in the future as it makes connecting different devices across the lab much easier.",

Swerve utilizes four wheels which are able to be independently turned 360 degrees. I worked to solve the new and challenging electrical and programming challenges which came with this new drive train. Examples of these challenges included accurately measuring wheel position and maintaining robot orientation. Silver won the Iowa regional and made it to the world competition.",

This photo is also representative of my greater obsession with work flow. I build my own custom keyboards, create custom keyboard layouts, type in Dvorak (A more efficient keyboard layout), and use a variety of different programs and desktop environments (Where appropriate) to optimize my work on computers.",
